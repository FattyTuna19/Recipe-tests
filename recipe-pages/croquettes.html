    <p>If followed closely, here is how your Croquettes will look</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nutmeg</li>
        <li>Breadsrumbs</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating the butter and oil in a heavy pan.</li>
        <li>When fully melted and hot, add the onions and sauté for about 5 minutes--until just starting to color.</li>
        <li>Next, mix in the nutmeg and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Add the diced Serrano ham and cook for no more than a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and sauté, stirring constantly to cook the flour without burning it.</li>
        <li>Once the flour has browned, it's time to add the milk.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, over the next 15-20 minutes. Every time the mixture gets dry, add some more milk.</li>
        <li>Once all the milk has been added and the dough is creamy and thick, remove it from the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the croquette dough into a large bowl, and let it cool to room temperature. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the dough, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight).</li>
        <li>When it's cool, take it out of the fridge and make little logs using spoons or a piping bag.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>First, prepare the breading steps of flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Bread each croquette in flour.</li>
        <li>Dip each croquette in egg.</li>
        <li>End the breading process by coating the logs in breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Place on top of wax paper if you wish so they don't stick.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy frying pan and once hot (but not smoking), add the croquettes. Fry for 5 minutes, turning halfway through to ensure they brown evenly on all sides.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towel, and let them cool for a few minutes, then enjoy!</li>
